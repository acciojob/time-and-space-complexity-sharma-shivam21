	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, a key concept in computer science, describes how an algorithm's execution time scales with the size of its input, often using Big O notation to represent the worst-case scenario. 
</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>  is a measure of how much memory an algorithm uses to solve a problem. It's an important metric for understanding how efficient an algorithm is O(n). </p>
