	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a mesure of the computational efficiency of an algorithm 
	, including how the run time increases with input size . For example , an algorithm with O(n)
	space complexity requires memory proportional to the input size.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm 
	requires as a function of the input size.  For example , an algorithm with O(n) space complexity requires memory proportional to the input size.</p>
